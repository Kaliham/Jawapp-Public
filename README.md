## 1.1 Introduction

Jawapp is an app submission for the risk management sector, it’s designed to help enable people to help, organize/manage resource consumption, and give information about pandemic, risk or any dangerous situation facing the citizens of jordan.

Jawapp features are divided into three important categories:

1. **Enabling people to help each other**; through volunteer posts which people can participate in. For example the devastating explosion in lebanon; the effect of that explosion couldn’t be repaired/handled with government only people volunteered, this part of the app enables more people to do so and be aware of where/how and what is needed.
1. **Resource management and distribution**; to mitigate people fear, over buying, and hoarding limited resources. For example face masks in Jordan were in high demand and a lot of people over bought them at insane prices. We can fight this with limiting what people can purchase ( through the family book “دفتر العائلة“) and provide a map of nearest source to buy these resource. This also enables us to group people and families into buying on certain days.
1. **Raising awareness and informative summary of current rules and regulations**. Through pandemics and dire situations countries change, add, and iterate on rules and regulations. A summative list of current rules and regulations helps people keep up with change and enable the government to iterate quickly to mitigate risks. Additionally in our community and culture sometimes rumors or misinformation specially about pandemics are spread, i.e: hand sanitizer is more effective than soap and water, which lead people to buy huge quantities of hand sanitizer even though these rumors aren’t correct.

The screen above shows the resource management screen; which helps users find shops, pharmacys, bakers, .etc which sell these limited goods. This helps the government keep track of which resources are limited in quantity and authorize a limited number that a citizen can buy depending on their family book “دفتر العائلة“.

### 1.2.4 Procedures and Recommendation

This screen on the left, shows informative Procedures, on how to handle certain situation throw a pandemic/disaster, or recommendations(i.e: apps to order groceries from), recommendations also include clearing misinformation which can occur through pandemic especially through social media (i.e: Facebook post).

This part of the app is important to spread the correct information and raise awareness to people in jordan.

This screen also includes previous or future disaster prevention procedures or risk mitigation procedures (other : procedures), also when a current pandemic/disaster is over all the “current” posts go to “other”.

### 1.2.5 Area Control

Area Control is a flexible solution for the government to control areas, and users to get information or possibly perform a certain procedure (i.e: stay in lockdown if your area is under contamination).

Circles can be color coded, for example yellow; residents of the area are under lockdown, red; contaminated area residents are under lockdown and outsiders aren’t allowed to enter without authorization, blue; help is needed ( can move you to the volunteer work post screen).
